# BeautifulSoup-Python
Search Images from Bing search engine and download them using BeautifulSoup library.

This is my first program with python. It is an example of BeautifulSoup library.

I'm also new in python programming language and also github.
I would be so happy if anyone has a tip for me.
Thanks in advance.
