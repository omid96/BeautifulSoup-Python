# BeautifulSoup-Python
Search Images from Bing search engine and download them using BeautifulSoup library.

This is my first program with python and I just want to share it to see how it works on github.

I'm also new in python programming language and also github.
I would be so happy if anyone has a tip for me.
Thanks in advance.
